algorithm_descriptions = {
    "Bubble Sort": "Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.",
    "Insertion Sort": "Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.",
    "Selection Sort": "Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.",
    "Merge Sort": "Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.",
    "Quick Sort": "Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays.",
    "Heap Sort": "Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.",
    "Counting Sort": "Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value.",
    "Bucket Sort": "Bucket Sort works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually."
